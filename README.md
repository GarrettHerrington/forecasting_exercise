This forecasting project was done using the book "Datamining for Business Analytics" and has provided a great foundation in which to learn forecasting.

It included libraries like pandas, statsmodels, and dmba.

The data used was bicycle rental data from a company that rents bicycles and wants to use that data to predict bicycle rentals.

I effectively used forecasting to determine an estimate of how many bicycles to expect to be rented at a given point in time.
